Playing around with the  tutorial of the Arduino starter kit.

## arduino_calc

The program prints to the console the sum of 5 + 188, and followed by the blinking of an LED on the microcontroller, with a one-second delay between each blink.

## arduino_arrays

An exercise in arrays in Arduino. Static vs. dynamic arrays and for loops

##arduino_if

Control flow: if/else statements

##arduino_switchcase

Control flow: using switch/cases for control flow

##arduino_for_loops
An exercise in learning for loops

##arduino_while_loops
Learning about three kinds of while loops

##arduino_functions_1 & _2
Must be introduced by specifying their return value-type (int, byte, void etc.). In both examples, their definitions come after they are called.

##arduino_continue
Skips the rest of a code within a loop. Much like `next` in Ruby
