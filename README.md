Playing around with the  tutorial of the Arduino starter kit.

## arduino_calc

The program prints to the console the sum of 5 + 188, and followed by the blinking of an LED on the microcontroller, with a one-second delay between each blink.

## arduino_arrays

An exercise in arrays in Arduino. Static vs. dynamic arrays and for loops

##arduino_if

Control flow: if/else statements

##arduino_switchcase

Control flow: using switch/cases for control flow

##arduino_for_loops
An exercise in learning for loops

##arduino_while_loops
Learning about three kinds of while loops

##arduino_functions_1 & _2
Must be introduced by specifying their return value-type (int, byte, void etc.). In both examples, their definitions come after they are called.

##arduino_continue
Skips the rest of a code within a loop. Much like `next` in Ruby

##arduino_map
Useful for mapping one range to the other. ideally suited to scale a great input variable to a smaller output variable.

##arduino_constrain
Constrains all values passed within the range given by parameters 2 and 3.

##arduino_serial_available
A demonstraion of how Serial.available() works. Checks to see whether a character is available in the serial buffer or not. On sending a character in the terminal, the serial will return "I have received the following character" plus the ASCII code for the character.

##arduino_ascii
Writes an ascii table to the console window. For example:
	`a, dec: 97, hex: 61, oct: 141, bin: 1100001`

##arduino_serial_print

Writes to the serial: 1) the ASCII code 65, and returns 'A'; 2) a string 3) an array of strings, which is joined in the function Serial.write(array, length)
